      <h1>Once upon a time they found me!</h1>
      <p>I was born in Buenos Aires. I’m not sure when. My story is a mystery until a a few years back. Somehow I ended up living with a guy at an old building. He dances tango and loves music, but he didn’t have too much time for me. Many people came and went from my house, but I liked nobody.</p>
      <p>I was old, skinny and with rotten teeth. However, one wonderful November, a beautiful girl came to my life. She and her mate adopted me, took me to the vet, played with me, and made my life awesome. Now we are a small family in Buenos Aires. I love my humans.</p>
